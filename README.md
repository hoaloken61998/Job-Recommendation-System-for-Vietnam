Job Recommendation System for Vietnam

# Job Recommendation System for Vietnam

A **job recommendation system** tailored for the Vietnamese labor market, combining **Content-Based Filtering (CBF)** with **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.  

This project was developed as part of the *Web Data Analytics* course final project, and also demonstrates skills in **data collection, NLP, and recommender systems** ‚Äî directly applicable to real-world applications in **HR Tech, e-commerce, and AI-driven platforms**.

## üìñ Project Overview
The Vietnamese labor market faces a paradox: despite thousands of job postings and resumes available online, **job seekers and employers struggle to connect effectively**. Challenges include mismatched expectations, lack of standardized job descriptions, and noisy recruitment data.  

This project addresses these challenges by building a **personalized recommendation system** that:  
- Uses **Content-Based Filtering (CBF)** to match candidate profiles (CVs) with job postings (JDs).  
- Leverages advanced **Vietnamese NLP models** (TF-IDF, Pho2Vec, PhoBERT) to represent text data semantically.  
- Evaluates performance using **real-world datasets**:  
  - **46,000+ candidate profiles** from Timviec365.vn.  
  - **21,000+ job postings** from CareerViet.vn.  

The system demonstrates that **PhoBERT + PCA embeddings** significantly improve recommendation accuracy, reaching:  
- Precision@30: **93%**  
- nDCG@30: **97%**  
- MAP@30: **94%**  


## ‚ú® Features
- üîé **Data Crawling**: Automated scraping of 46,000 candidate CVs (Timviec365.vn) and 21,000 job postings (CareerViet.vn).  
- üßπ **Preprocessing**: Text cleaning, tokenization (ViTokenizer), normalization of salary & experience.  
- üß† **NLP Models**:  
  - TF-IDF (baseline)  
  - Pho2Vec (100d & 300d)  
  - PhoBERT + PCA (best performance)  
- üìä **Evaluation Metrics**: Precision@K, Recall@K, nDCG@K, MAP@K.  
- üåê **Demo Web App**: Simple interface where a candidate uploads their CV and receives job recommendations.

## üöÄ Results
- **PhoBERT + PCA** achieved:  
  - Precision@30: **93%**  
  - nDCG@30: **97%**  
  - MAP@30: **94%**  

These results show strong potential for real-world deployment in Vietnam‚Äôs job market.
